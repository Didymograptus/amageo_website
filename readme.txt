TIP:
Open AGSi_Documentation_Contents.html - this provides an index to all the documentation.

Note that html docs not formatted yet. You may find them easier to read if you redeuce the width of your browser window.

In addition:
AGSi_ExampleData_Data.json is an example file.

The excel file duplicates the information in the AGSi_Documentation_Data_agsiData_... files, i.e same information, different format.

The rst files are the source for the html files. 

Please note that I have not yet documented, or indeed given much thought to the property/parameters codes. The example files includes some,
but they don't have to be like that. An issue to be discussed (not urgent).
